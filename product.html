                                            <br> A business continuity plan is a strategy to get a business up and running as soon as possible in the event of some type of disruption. The first step of creating a business continuity plan is conducting a risk assessment. In a risk assessment, you try to think of all possible business continuity threats and attempt to devise a plan to get the business up and running again as soon as possible should one of these threats occur.</p>
